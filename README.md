# Frogger-like Arcade Game

This project was accomplished during Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program. Feel free to send me your suggestion for improvements to info@alexis-bellet.com.

## How to run the game

The game is available online at the following address https://spaceyrezum.github.io/arcade-game/. Feel free to check it out.

## How to play

Frogger games are pretty simple. The goal is to reach the "win" tile at the top of the screen. To move, use the directional arrows located on your keyboard, :arrow_up: will make your player go up one row, same logic for :arrow_down:. :arrow_left: & :arrow_right: will make your player move sideways.

Note: it is not possible to go off-canvas, you will be block at the bottom, top, left or right edge of the field.

## Enemies & boats

So far, the only other interactive entities available in the game are enemies and boats. In order to reach the winning tile, you should avoid enemies and use boats to "surf" your way over water blocks.

## Ways to tweak the game

The game is currently only 4 levels. Each level presents a new set of difficulty. If you are interested in a harder game, increase the amount of enemies by tweaking the "addMoreEnemies" function in app.js. Suggestions could also help increase the amount of levels by adding new features. Don't hesitate to get in touch!

Have fun!
